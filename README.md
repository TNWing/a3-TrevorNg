HTML:  
- HTML input tags and form fields of various flavors (`<textarea>`, `<input>`, checkboxes, radio buttons etc.)
- HTML that can display all data *for a particular authenticated user*. Note that this is different from the last assignnment, which required the display of all data in memory on the server.

Node.js:  
- A server using Express and a persistent database (mongodb).

General:  
- Your site should achieve at least 90% on the `Performance`, `Best Practices`, `Accessibility`, and `SEO` tests 
using Google [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) (don't worry about the PWA test, and don't worry about scores for mobile devices).
Test early and often so that fixing problems doesn't lead to suffering at the end of the assignment. 

Deliverables
---

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements. I'd begin by converting your A2 assignment. First, change the server to use express. Then, modify the server to use mongodb instead of storing data locally. Last but not least, implement user accounts and login. User accounts and login is often the hardest part of this assignment, so budget your time accordingly.
2. If you developed your project locally, deploy your project to Glitch (unless completing the alternative server technical acheivement described below), and fill in the appropriate fields in your package.json file.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch (or an alternative server), it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a3-FirstnameLastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a3-FirstnameLastname`.

Acheivements
---

Below are suggested technical and design achievements. You can use these to help boost your grade up to an A and customize the 
assignment to your personal interests, for a maximum twenty additional points and a maximum grade of a 100%. 
These are recommended acheivements, but feel free to create/implement your own... just make sure you thoroughly describe what you did in your README, 
why it was challenging, and how many points you think the achievement should be worth. 
ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM.

*Technical*
- (10 points) Implement OAuth authentication, perhaps with a library like [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/). 
*You must either use Github authenticaion or provide a username/password to access a dummy account*. 
Course staff cannot be expected, for example, to have a personal Facebook, Google, or Twitter account to use when grading this assignment. 
Please contact the course staff if you have any questions about this. THIS IS THE HARDEST ACHEIVEMENT OFFERED IN WEBWARE. You have been warned!  
- (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service. Find a service that is reputable and has a free tier. Post your findings on Slack in the #assignment3 channel. DO NOT feel compelled to purchase a paid tier from any service, although if you already have one, you are welcome to use it. Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse? 
- (5 points) Get 100% (not 98%, not 99%, but 100%) in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.  

*Design/UX*
- (10 points) Make your site accessible using the [resources and hints available from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), Implement/follow twelve tips from their [tips for writing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/), [tips for designing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/), and [tips for development](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/). *Note that all twelve must require active work on your part*. 
For example, even though your page will most likely not have a captcha, you don't get this as one of your twelve tips to follow because you're effectively 
getting it "for free" without having to actively change anything about your site. 
Contact the course staff if you have any questions about what qualifies and doesn't qualify in this regard. 
List each tip that you followed and describe what you did to follow it in your site.
- (5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings. 
Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page? 
How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page? 
What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site? 
How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements. 
Write a paragraph of at least 125 words *for each of four principles* (four paragraphs, 500 words in total).

## Maze Generator Beta 1.0

Glitch:

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:
This application is a simple maze generator. Giuen a set of parameters, it creates a rectangular tile-based maze. While the maze isn't currently
interactable, in the future I can use this maze to create an actual game where the user needs to navigate out of it.

There were two main challenges here:
-User-Data Association
While I can associate a maze with its creator using mongodb, I
didn't know how to preserve user credentials.
I ended up looking at the middleware express-session to keep track of the user's session.

-Maze Generation
While I followed the initial guide of using depth-first search, I
wanted to be more flexibile in regards to how my maze works. For instance, one 
of the current parameters is Amount of Exits. This creates a maze with multiple exits. Albiet, with its
current design, mazes with multiple exits do end up having areas of open space in them.

As mentioned previously, my authentication strategy used the express-session middleware. I felt it was easier to implement than other
options (mainly since) doing it manually would be more limiting and difficult. Also, it is based around express, so it felt appropriate.


I decided to go with the NES.css. Since I'm generating a simple maze, I feel like a game-oriented style would be fitting. I didn't really make any modifications to it though.

Express Middleware Packages
-Express-Session
This hands over managing the user sessions to the package, making it easy to authenticate and keep track of users.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:I used express-session alongside mongodb to manage users, their mazes, and keep track of user sessions.
- **Tech Achievement 2**:I utilized a depth-first search to generate a maze that I could display on a canvas.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative...

Sample User
Username:User1
Password:ABC

you can also create your own user if you want
